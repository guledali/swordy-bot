# This is an older version of Swordy Bot - not the live production app!  

#### NOTE: You should not expect this to work out-of-the-box, but rather use it as an example and a learning tool. Here are some of my takeaways from this version:

- **Most important!** The app logic should not be split between the Heroku Discord Bot and the RedwoodJS app. Instead, the Heroku Discord Bot should be as "dumb" as possible, and simply act as a messenger between Discord and the RedwoodJS app. 
- I did not implement Discord OAuth here, but rather my own solution for verifying ownership which requires DM'ing. Using the Discord Oauth is a better solution overall in terms of UX, and is harder to break, despite being much more work to implement.
- This bot requires DM'ing the user a unique link to verify ownership. This is an anti-pattern, since many users disable DM'ing from other server participants to prevent spam. This means the bot simply appears "broken" to this set of users.

## Whats included

- **Discord bot** w/ docker container in `/bot`
- **API server** RedwoodJS API in `/api`
- **(incomplete) Frontend** RedwoodJS web app in `/web`

## Local Development

Setup the backend + frontend

```bash
yarn

# Initialize SQL-lite and perform initial migrations
yarn rw db save
yarn rw db up

# Start the API service and Frontend
yarn rw dev
```

Start the bot

```bash
cd bot && yarn
yarn start
```

## Going to Production

The easiest way to deploy is using Vercel for the frontend and backend, and Heroku for the bot and postgres database. Hosting this way is free, and can be setup in about 10 minutes.

In order to collect all the required environment variables, you'll need to deploy all three parts (bot, FE+BE, discord app), and go back and update as necessary.

### Vercel - Backend + Frontend

Point vercel to your repo, and deploy. Redwood build commands should be auto-configured.

Update the environment variables for what you see in the root `.env` file. The only new one is `DATABASE_URL` which you need from your Heroku database in the next step.

### Heroku - Bot

Heroku doesn't like apps that aren't in the root folder. To get around this, I added a `heroku-prebuild` script which installs the bot dependencies. The Procfile runs the `bot.js`

Once deployed, head to the "Resources" tab, turn off the `web` Dyno, and turn on the `worker` Dyno. This Dyno is defined in the repo root `Procfile`.

Update the environment variables in "Settings" tab to reflect what you see in the `.env` here.

Add a new postgres add-on and add the url to the Vercel environment.

### Discord

Create a new application at https://discord.com/developers. Don't worry about naming here.

Now in your app, navigate to "Bot" and create a bot. Choose a username and Icon for your bot here.

Leave "Bot Permissions" alone.

Copy the `TOKEN` and add it to your bot app.

Now add the bot to your server. In the Discord Application, in "General Information", copy the `CLIENT ID`. Insert it in this URL, and have the server administrator open it.

```
# Add the bot with role management permissions
https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=<clientID>&scope=bot&permissions=268435456
```

## Docker option

If you want to avoid Heroku for the bot, you can use docker. If you've made changes to the bot, you'll need to generate a new Docker image.

```bash
# Build
docker build -t <your username>/unlock-protocol-discord-bot .

# Test it out
docker run -p 8080:8080 -d <your username>/unlock-protocol-discord-bot

# Publish it when ready!
```

When you're ready to host the container, clone this repo on your server and navigate to this package. If you published your own version, the update the image name in `docker-compose.yml`. Be sure to update your `.env` file on the new machine as well.

```bash
# Load the .env file
source .env

# Start in "detached" mode
docker-compose up -d
```

## Notes

- If you have permissions errors, try giving the bot a higher role. Bots can only give roles to members in a _lower position_ than their own highest role. See https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/permissions#permission-hierarchy
