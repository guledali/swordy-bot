# How to build a token-centric community

Good reasons for building a token-centric community:

- DAOs for giving grants
- DAOs for doing work
- Tokens for Defi protocols
- An altruistic cause you think others also
- Artist or Content-Creator with a following

Bad reasons for building a token-centric community:

- Making money or influencing token prices
- A poorly researched idea.
- Harm or put-down others

## Purpose

Do not be extractive. No one will want to participate if they feel they are being taken advantage of. In order to success, your community must have a clear purpose that people can get behind.

## People

Identify a small Power Squad so you can

# Practical Steps

# From 0-10 Members

## Platform

Discord is the best place to build, since you need separate channels which are topic-focused. To get you started, I created a template you can use to get started:

The key elements are:

1.  Keep things simple and concise. Rambling conversations on 100 different channels is not helpful.
2.  Organize topics with clear names. Rather than name a channel "inner-chambers", instead use something like "DAO-members". This prevents newcomers from being overwhelmed with jargon.
3.  Have outlets for being social and hanging out. All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. Consider making a Category just for gaming, random topics, memes, and listening to music with [groovy bot](https://groovy.bot/).

## Social bonds

The third element in the above list is very important. Communities find strength when they discover mutually shared values, beyond the prescribed goals. If a small cohort from your community discover they all enjoy listening to Taylor Swift, a social bond will form. These bonds cannot be created artificially, so you must provide space for them to occur organically.

> Your community is only as strong the bonds between its members.

Scheduling work-free low-effort hangouts is a great way to help bootstrap the process of shared-interest discovery. For example, host a weekly non-mandatory **happy hour**, casual multiplayer gaming, or chess tournament.

You'll begin to see common interests develop, and your members will start to ask about adding topic-specific channels for them to "geek-out". If achieve this goal, your community will become stronger than ever.

## Opening the Doors to the Public

Awesome! You're ready to open your community up to outsiders. You've already laid a strong foundation, and new members joining will be able to tell.

Before you start advertising yourself, you should already have identified your "core-contributors". AND you should already have a handful of work-specific channels created.

Before you open your doors to the public, here are a few things you need to complete:

- [Enable Your Community Server](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047132851-Enabling-Your-Community-Server)(_mandatory_) in your server's settings. This is the easy-button for ensuring you have the correct settings fro explicit content-filters, security/safety, and notifications. It also enables a couple other features which will come in handy.
- Create a welcome screen

### Set up a Code of Conduct

If you want to attract a diverse membership (and you do), then you must do your part to fight discrimination. One of the core requirements for doing so is to adopt and abide by a Code of Conduct.

> This is your signal to the world that you're not a gaggle of immature fuckboys.

The open-source software community already has a great Code of Conduct. You can read, understand, and use ours from [contributor-covenant.org](http://contributor-covenant.org/).

p.s. If you skip this step, probably no one will tell you, because they think your community is close-minded. Don't foster a close-minded community. I'm telling you now, so you have no excuse.

### Define the Rules

These don't have to be complicated. Get the easy stuff out of the way towards the top: "No spamming or shilling, unless its directly related to the community". Keep it simple enough that your members actually read it.

Your goal here is "self-policing". The better your members understand the rules, the less work moderating you have to do.

# From 100 Members and beyond

## Permissions

### Setting up roles

Now that you've attracted some members

### Using bots

I already mentioned how groovy-bot can help connect members. Another bot

- Haus Bot
- CollabLand
- Swordy Bot

## Go Global

Its time to open up a few channels in other languages. Even if you can't understand whats happening, or help moderate, your community members will be very excited to chat with fellow native speakers. And since everyone knows the rules by now, you can have more confidence that the channel will be self-moderated.

Here's a good list to start with:

- français
- deutsch
- 日本語
- pусский
- español
